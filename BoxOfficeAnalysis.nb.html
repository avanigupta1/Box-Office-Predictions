# Section 1: Training Data Analysis and Modeling

##1. Research Question

Can a combination of distribution, release, and marketing factors predict the opening weekend box office revenue for movies in the United States?
 

To delve into this question, an exploratory analysis was done, as opposed to a hypothesis-driven one. Additionally, the movie’s budget was not taken into consideration, as the aim of this study was to focus on what, and to what extent, aspects surrounding the perception of a movie result in the audience’s willingness to see it during it’s opening weekend.

To proceed with the analysis, variables were initially chosen based on theoretical assumptions and then tested for usability later on.
The response variable is 'Opening Mil', which is the total US opening weekend revenue of a film, in millions. Theatre count, month and year of release, runtime, and distribution studio were then added in. Additionally, the primary listed genre was taken into account, along with a self reported variable called 'type'. The aim of including type was to take into account a film's place in a wider pop cultural landscape, such as whether it was based on pre-existing intellectual property or if it was an extension of a franchise. Lastly, scores from 'The Bankability Index' were included to account for star power and how important certain stars or directors are in corralling an audience to the theatre.  


The following data has been aggregated from websites such as BoxOfficeMojo, IMDb, and The Numbers Bankability Index.

##3. Initial Limitations

Though the analysis attempts to incorporate a variety of impactful factors, there are strong limitations present, such as:

- Small sample size and arbitrary cut off: the data only takes into account the top 100 movies of the past 8 years
- Inability to gauge the change in audience interaction with film in the last decade in regards to YouTube and social media
- Inability to incorporate social conversation, such as a sudden social media push or scandal surrounding the film
- Potential errors in self-reported variables such as ‘Type’
- Incomplete representation of all cast and crew in the sum that composes the ‘Bankability’ variable


##4. Methods of Analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
############## MODELING ASSUMPTIONS

#density plot to see if data is normal
a <- density((OpeningMil)) 
plot(a)

#not normal - try logging opening mil
d <- density(log(OpeningMil)) 
plot(d)
#this works! use going forward

#create log response variable
logOpeningMil <- log(OpeningMil)

#other assumptions- 
# sample size not too large but doable
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
############## CORRELATION

#check correlation between continuous variables
contFull <- data.frame(TheatreThou, logOpeningMil, Bankability, Runtime)
cor(contFull)
#highest correlation between theatre and opening - do not feel this is strong enough to remove one variable
#keep all in and move onto plotting

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, messages = FALSE}
############## VARIABLE RELATIONSHIPS

#Plot 1: Opening vs. Theatre Count vs. Bankability vs. Runtime
pairs(logOpeningMil~ TheatreThou + Bankability + Runtime, data = fullSet)
#very clear square relationship btwn opening and theatre
#theatre and bank?

#Plot 1.b: Log Opening vs. Theatre Count^2
plot(logOpeningMil, (TheatreThou), pch=1, cex = .5, ylab ="Log Opening Box Office", xlab ="Theatre")
plot(logOpeningMil, (TheatreThou+TheatreThou.2), pch=1, cex = .5, ylab ="Log Opening Box Office", xlab ="Theatre^2")
#square theatre count moving on

#Plot 2: Opening vs. Runtime
plot(Runtime, logOpeningMil, pch=1, cex = .5, ylab ="Log Opening Box Office", xlab ="Runtime")
#very scattered

#Plot 3: Opening vs. Year
boxplot(logOpeningMil~Year, data = fullSet, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Log Opening Box Office")
#common mean, max's slight curve

#Plot 4: Max Opening Per Year
maxYear <- aggregate(logOpeningMil ~ Year, fullSet, max)
plot(maxYear)
#not particularly interesting

#Plot 5: Opening vs. Type
boxplot(logOpeningMil~Type, data = fullSet, xlab = "Type", ylab = "Log Opening Box Office")
#interesting

#Ridge 1: Opening vs. Type
ggplot(fullSet, aes(x = logOpeningMil, y = Type, fill = Type)) +
  geom_density_ridges(scale=2) +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + geom_boxplot(aes(x = logOpeningMil, y = Type, fill = Type)) +  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(levels(Type)))
#using the logged openingmil shows the distributions strangely but clearly indicates that franchise, remake, and sequel have broad ranges

#Plot 6: Opening vs. Genre
boxplot(logOpeningMil~Genre1, data = fullSet, xlab = "Genre", ylab = "Log Opening Box Office")
#interesting

#Ridge 2: Opening vs. Genre
ggplot(fullSet, aes(x = logOpeningMil, y = Genre1, fill = Genre1)) +
  geom_density_ridges(scale=2) +
  theme_ridges() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
#fantasy & mystery = bimodal

#Plot 7: Opening vs. Month
boxplot(logOpeningMil~Month, data = fullSet, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Log Opening Box Office")
#May highest

#Plot 8: Opening vs. Studio
boxplot(logOpeningMil~Studio, data = fullSet, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Log Opening Box Office")
#VERY scattered and definitely important


```

### *Model Construction*

As the response variable of note is continuous, a linear model was chosen to analyze the data. 

### *Regression Assumptions*

- **Sample Size:** While it would be more prudent to have a larger set in this sort of analysis, the analysis set consists of 800 movies. 

- **Normal Distribution:** Initially, the response data was extremely right skewed. However, after logging the variable, the distribution proved to be normal.

- **Multicollinearity Concerns:** The highest correlation between any continuous variable is ~0.7, which is on the higher end, but does not necessarily negate either variable’s use in the analysis. 


#### *Exploratory Data Analysis*

Regarding the continuous variables, there seemed to be a clear quadratic relationship between the response variable, Opening Mil(Log), and Theatre Thou, as can be seen below. 


```{r, echo = FALSE}
####Bubble Plot1: Opening, Theatre, Runtime

```


Within the categorical variables, Genre1, Type, Month, and Studio were all extremely varied across sub-categories. Additionally, many interactions seemed present, such as Genre1 and Type, however they were either hindered by under-representation of level-level relationships in the data, or were merely somewhat correlated as opposed to interactive. 


### *Linear Modeling*

After testing out the usability of variables and potential interactions using interaction analysis and ANOVA tests, the final linear model is as follows: 

$$Log Opening Box Office _Mil = Theatre + Theatre^2 + Runtime + Bankability +$$ 
$$Release Year + Release Month + Holiday Weekend + Distribution Studio + Primary Genre + Type$$

Previously included variables, such as ‘GenreNum’, were present in the analysis. The variable served to address the fact that many films are an amalgam of genres, and was included over a secondary genre variable, as there were too many missing values in the dataset. ‘GenreNum’ was eventually removed due to seeming insignificance resulting from a nested F-test.


The final model summary is as follows: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
predict.lm <- lm(logOpeningMil ~ TheatreThou + TheatreThou.2+ Runtime + Bankability + as.factor(Year) +
              Studio + Genre1 + Holiday + Type + Month, data=fullSet)
summary(predict.lm)

```

### *Residuals & Influence Diagnostics*

When reviewing influence diagnostics such as Leverage and Cook’s Distance, the 7 outlying points were all within categories that were relatively under-represented in the data (such as Rereleases and Fantasy films). These points were not removed. 


The residuals of the final linear model were fairly well vertically-distributed, as can be seen below:  


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages("ggfortify")
#devtools::install_github("thomasp85/patchwork")
library(patchwork)
library(ggfortify)
predfort <- fortify(predict.lm)


#Residual Plots

pf1 <- ggplot(predfort, aes(x = Month, y = .resid)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())
pf2 <- ggplot(predfort, aes(x = Year, y = .resid)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_hline(yintercept = 0)+ theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())

##5. Interpretations & Takeaways

Using the linear model created above, the observed values in the 800-movie dataset were plotted against the predicted values to get a sense of fit, as seen below: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

#OBSERVED V FITTED - create dataframe
ObsVPred <- data.frame(Movie1 = fullSet$Movie, Observed = fullSet$OpeningMil, Fit = fitted(predict.lm))
ObsVPred$Predicted <- exp(ObsVPred$Fit) #exponentiate for true value


#Convert DF to Melt
obspred <- data.frame(ObsVPred)
obspred$Fit <- NULL
obspred$Movie1 <- factor(obspred$Movie1, levels = obspred$Movie1) #convert to factor to retain sorted order in plot

obspred.melt <- melt(obspred, id.vars = 'Movie1', variable.name = 'Value', 
    value.name = 'BoxOffice')

#Plot
ggplot(obspred.melt, aes(x = Movie1, y = BoxOffice, shape = Value, color = Value))+
geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values = c("Observed" = '#228B22','Predicted' = '#800000')) + 
scale_shape_manual(values = c('Observed' = 17, 'Predicted' = 16)) + scale_size_manual(values=c(8,8)) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = obspred$Movie1[seq(1, length(obspred$Movie1), by = 60)]) + theme_bw() +
  labs(subtitle = 'Observed vs. Predicted Opening Box Office Revenue', x = "Movie", y = "Opening in Millions") + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=7,angle=0,hjust=1,vjust=0,face="plain"), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.title.y=element_blank())  + geom_hline(yintercept = 0)

```

While the model resulted in 60 estimated coefficients, due to the categorical nature of much of the data, the following have been extracted to best summarize the results of the regression.

The estimated opening weekend intercept value is **$25.4 million**, with a 95% CI of \$14.17 mil to \$45.53 mil


With all else being held constant:

* Moving from a release on a non-holiday weekend to a holiday weekend estimates a **7.8% decrease** (CI: -15% to -0.03%)
This result on its surface looks incorrect, as one would assume a holiday film would appeal to a wider audience. However, the estimates are aggregated as Friday-Sunday, while holiday movies get a bulk of their audience during the non-weekend days associated with said holiday. 

* An increase of 15 minutes in a film’s runtime is estimated to constitute a **7.5%** increase in revenue (CI: 4.2% to 10.9%)
This also seems problematic, as this may make sense for films only in the lower end of the set 

* An increase in Bankability score by 100 points is estimated to lead to a **6.2%** increase in revenue (CI: 4.6% to 7.9%)

* Month and Studio both prove to be problematic, as the estimates either have large p-values or unusually large confidence intervals. 

* February, commonly known as ‘Dumpuary’ in Hollywood as many ‘bad’ movies are released, is estimated as the highest grossing month with a **6.4% increase** from the second-ranked month. This is accompanied by a large CI from -7.8% to 22.8%.  

* Disney has the highest estimate with **9.98% increase** from the base-level, with a vast CI from -19.8% to 51.%.
 
* Revenues seem to progressively decrease as the years increase, with 2017 showing an estimated **decrease of 29.7%** from 2010 CI: -37.7% to -20.66%)

# Section 2: Predictive Modeling for 2018

Using the linear model created in the previous section, would it be possible to predict the highest grossing films of 2018?

### *Data Collection*
```{r, echo = FALSE}
##Prediction Test
test2018 <- read_excel("~/Desktop/Duke - Completed/Fall 2018/Stats/Final Project/GIT/2018 - Test Set.xlsx")

#Update Variables
#set variables
#continuous
Movie <- test2018$Movie #not a variable
TheatreThou <- test2018$TheatreThou
TheatreThou.2 <- test2018$TheatreThou.2
Runtime <- test2018$Runtime
Bankability <- test2018$BANKABILITY

#categorical
Year <- as.factor(test2018$Year)
Studio <- as.factor(test2018$Studio)
Holiday <- as.factor(test2018$Holiday)

#Relevel Genre - Create Factor
test2018$Genre1 <- as.factor(test2018$Genre1)
test2018$Genre1 = factor(test2018$Genre1,levels(test2018$Genre1)[c(7,1:6,8)])
Genre1 <- as.factor(test2018$Genre1)


#Relevel Month - Create Factor
test2018$Month <- as.factor(test2018$Month)
test2018$Month = factor(test2018$Month,levels(test2018$Month)[c(4,1:3,5:12)])
Month <- as.factor(test2018$Month)

#Relevel Type - Create Factor
test2018$Type <- as.factor(test2018$Type)
test2018$Type = factor(test2018$Type,levels(test2018$Type)[c(2,1,3:5)])
Type <- as.factor(test2018$Type)


#PREDICT 2018
preds18 <- predict(predict.lm, newdata = test2018, type='response')
predict2018 <- cbind(test2018,preds18)
predict2018$PredBOExp <- exp(predict2018$preds18)

#MERGE ACTUAL BOX OFFICE
#load data
real2018 <- read_excel("~/Desktop/Duke - Completed/Fall 2018/Stats/Final Project/GIT/2018 - True Openings.xlsx")

all <- merge(predict2018, real2018, by="Movie")
compBO <- data.frame(Movie = all$Movie, Predicted = all$PredBOExp, Real = all$OpeningMil, Type = all$Type.x, Genre = all$Genre1.x)
```

Same data methods used to obtain a test set for the year 2018, from Jan 1 to Nov 29. 

### *Limitations* 

As 2018 was not present in the Year variable in the training set, 2017 was used in its place within the test set. 


### *Results*

Differences (observed minus predicted) were used to analyze the model. The absolute value mean of the differences was **11.34 mil**, with a standard deviation of **18.52 mil**. Results below:




```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())  

#update data frame
compBO <- data.frame(Movie = all$Movie, Predicted = all$PredBOExp, Real = all$OpeningMil, Type = all$Type.x, Genre = all$Genre1.x)


#diverging bar plot - descending by diff in pred
compBO$Difference <- (compBO$Real-compBO$Predicted) #create difference variable
compBO$movie_type <- ifelse(compBO$Difference < 0, "below", "above") # above below avg flag
compBO <- compBO[order(compBO$Difference), ] #sort
compBO$Movie <- factor(compBO$Movie, levels = compBO$Movie) #convert to factor to retain sorted order in plot

ggplot(compBO, aes(x=Movie, y=Difference, label=Difference)) + 
  geom_bar(stat='identity', aes(fill=movie_type), width=.5)  +
  scale_fill_manual(name="Predicted Box Office", 
                    labels = c("Over-Performed", "Under-Performed"), 
                    values = c("above"="springgreen4", "below"="firebrick2")) + 
  labs(subtitle="Predicted Difference") +  scale_x_discrete(breaks = compBO$Movie[c(3,11,21,30,40,50,61,70,80,90,100)])+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))

```


### *Takeaways*

Overperforming films such as Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians took on social importance during the lead-up to their releases, and became box office juggernauts. That type of groundswell has not been accounted for, and would be extremely difficult to gauge in a long-range forecasting effort.

### *Future Analysis*

As this is a very surface level analysis with an incredibly small sample size, it would be prudent to go deeper into prediction regression and modes of analysis for further inquiry.

# Section 3: The Rotten Tomatoes Effect

The film-score aggregator Rotten Tomatoes rose to prominence in 2016, and since then has been accused of being the cause of box-office failures. Is there any merit to these claims? As an off-shoot experiment of the primary analysis, Rotten Tomatoes data has been added into the dataset to analyze this argument. 


### *Data*

Rotten Tomatoes (RT) aggregates critic and audience reviews of a movie, and sums them to construct a score out of 100. Scores > 60 are classified as “Fresh”, and < 60 are considered “Rotten”. 

For this experiment, RT scores for each movie from 2016 and 2017 were obtained from the day before or of their release.

### *Analysis & Interpretation*

Two linear models were used to analyze this effect: using RT score as a continuous variable and using the RT classifications categorically. Both variables had significant p-values when predicting opening revenue, approximating that:

- A 1-point RT increase is estimated to result in a **0.39%** increase in revenue (95% CI: 0.11 % to 0.66%)
- Moving from Rotten to Fresh is estimated to have a **24.5%** increase in revenue (95% CI: 6.99% to 45%)
- Increase in RT score does not seem particularly impactful, however moving classification categories could have a drastic impact on box office. Figure below:

### *Limitations*

This particular experiment is based on a small dataset with minimal diagnostics, so much more analysis would need to be done to confidently discuss the merits of this claim.
